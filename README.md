## Introduction

NexFaster combines the best of both worlds: the powerful features of Next.js and the flexibility of React Router. This integration allows developers to take full advantage of client-side routing while maintaining the benefits of server-side rendering that Next.js offers. Whether you are building a simple application or a complex web platform, NexFaster provides the tools you need for efficient navigation.

## Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate React Router with your Next.js project.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Improve user experience with fast, client-side navigation.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Handle dynamic routes effortlessly.
- **Nested Routes**: Organize your application structure with nested routes.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Leverage Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities along with React Router's client-side routing.

## Installation

To get started with NexFaster, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/armjoywork2008y/nexfaster.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd nexFaster
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Setting Up Routes

To set up routes using NexFaster, you will need to create a `Router` component in your Next.js application. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './pages/Home';
import About from './pages/About';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Dynamic Routing

For dynamic routing, you can use parameters in your route definitions. Hereâ€™s an example:

```jsx
<Route path="/user/:id" component={UserProfile} />
```

In the `UserProfile` component, you can access the `id` parameter using the `useParams` hook from React Router:

```jsx
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function UserProfile() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  return <div>User Profile for ID: {id}</div>;
}
```

### Nested Routes

To create nested routes, simply nest `Route` components inside each other:

```jsx
<Route path="/dashboard">
  <Dashboard>
    <Route path="settings" component={Settings} />
    <Route path="profile" component={Profile} />
  </Dashboard>
</Route>
```
